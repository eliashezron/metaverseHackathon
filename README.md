# MyKidsNFT_Project

THE CODE:

My Kids NFT has a collection of smart contracts working in unison to bring together a complete project. We are focused
on user experience, since our target audience is families and children. 
1) Our first contract is a super easy ERC20 token "MyKidsToken.sol" or KIDS
2) Our main contract "MyKidsNFT.sol" consists of a minting function that is payable in multiple Tokens so we can 
incorporate and onboard more people to the Optimism blockchain. It also adds the capablity of using our KIDS token or 
any ERC20 Tokens from our partners / collaborators. This contract also contains a withdraw function with
multiple payout wallets to automate donating to our "Public Goods Funds."
3) A contract for donating only, which is split with Optimism to make all donations automatically shared to Optimism for their "Public Goods Fund."
4) Redemable allows KIDS to turn in thier earned token for a "Rentable" NFT, that is air dropped to the respective addresses.
5) through 7) Enable users to place thier NFT for rent, allowing Kids to learn even more valuable skills.
  -- 5) IERC4907 Acts as an interface  for communication with 
  -- 6) ERC4907, a groundbreaking new Standard that allows the separation
        of "Owner" from "User" in ERC720 (NFT) contracts. These work with 
  -- 7) "RentMyKidsNFT.sol", one of the 1st ever NFT rentable marketplaces.
  
  
  
  
  BRIEF INTRO:
  
  Our concept is simple yet effective.
Provide a safe environment where kids can learn about Block Chain technology, Web 3, AI, and all of the other aspects of the space.  Through the use of NFTs, and the Metaverse, we seek to engage their minds and inspire thier creativity.

OVERVIEW:

My Kids NFT through its very nature will help onboard kids in a fun way. This will instill a love for the Technology while developing a fundamental understanding of how it works. Through the use of blockchain, the metaverse, and fun challenges, kids learn healthy competition for success.
These challenges will be games, activities, workshops and other exciting ways to gain points. These points unlock levels and Perks that reward the user for thier hard work.
Rewards can range from unlocked levels, badges, token, and even other NFTs wich enhance the ones they already own. These PFP are also thier access to our members only areas within our Discord, Metaverse, events and more. They can earn unlimited token by completing fun learning tasks that help them learn about the space.

Even better we have added an NFT Rental Marketplace! Here kids can learn and earn while strengthening thier entrepreneurial skills. While renting out thier NFTs, thier users can partake in all of the benefits of owning a My Kids NFT. Without having to relinquish ownership. Thus teaching them even more life enhancing skills, and gaining even more from thier NFT.

But that is only part of the community at MKN. We also provide many free, fun activities where kids can partake even without ownership! There are also many chances to win a free My Kids NFT. Holders do have added perks, our NFT's are intended to be a users' access to the "VIP" metaverse, and holders only areas within the community, but there is still plenty of free goods, and we welcome everyone to come join the family.

Our KIDS token will also be air dropped to all holders on a monthly basis. These are in house utility tokens, that are redeemed towards many rewards that are added often through collaborations and more.




PUBLIC GOODS FUND:

There are also plans for an international Summer Camp, where children get immersive learning, and a nutritional meal while having a blast. This is just one way we plan to give back to the Community. Check the Summer Camp Proposal for details.




THE NUMBERS:

Through a Series of NFT drops, My Kids NFT seeks to fund blessings for many generations to come.
Starting with Our Genesis Collection of 5k Hybrid NFTs, priced at roughly 0.035 eth / $40 USD. Which is low enough for most people, from all walks of life, worldwide to afford. It is actually less than the average price for a family of 4 to eat at McDonald's.  We did this strategically to ensure that all children can be included in this community.




SUMMARY:

In brief, My Kids NFT seeks to set a higher standard for utility and value within an NFT, to its holders. It simultaneously will help enrich the lives and education of Children through multi faceted venues that will shape our future world leaders.

Help us make a difference.  Support our project, and give kids a boost to get started ahead in the right direction.

# MyKidsNFT_Project_Codes
These are the codes used in creating the My Kids NFT project.

Summary:

My Kids NFT has a collection of smart contracts working in unison to bring together a complete project. We are focused
on user experience, since our target audience is families and children. 
1) Our first contract is a super easy ERC20 token "MyKidsToken.sol" or KIDS
2) Our main contract "MyKidsNFT.sol" consists of a minting function that is payable in multiple Tokens so we can 
incorporate and onboard more people to the Optimism blockchain. It also adds the capablity of using our KIDS token or 
any ERC20 Tokens from our partners / collaborators. This contract also contains a withdraw function with
multiple payout wallets to automate donating to our "Public Goods Funds."
3) A contarct for donating only, which is split with Optimism to make all donations automatically shared to Optimism for their "Public Goods Fund."
4) through 6) Enable users to place thier NFT for rent, allowing Kids to learn even more valuable skills.
IERC4907 Acts as an interface  for communication with ERC4907, a groundbreaking new Standard that allows the separation
of "Owner" from "User" in ERC720 (NFT) contracts. These work with "RentMyKidsNFT.sol", an NFT rentable marketplace.

These contracts were written for, and tested on the Optimism Goerli TestNet
 
All of our code comes with notes so anyone interested can use it / learn.
We hope you enjoy looking through this repository, and if you have any questions, just reach out.
